## Abstract: Unified Verification System for Out-of-State Scholarship Eligibility
The Unified Verification System is a comprehensive solution aimed at streamlining the process of verifying out-of-state students' eligibility for scholarships. Operating under the portal named SANGAM, this system integrates multiple levels of verification involving students, their educational institutions, and scholarship providers.

The process begins with user registration and profile creation. Upon submission of necessary documents and personal details, a unique portal ID is assigned, ensuring credibility and authenticity. This ID is granted post-verification, symbolizing the association with validated information.

Education institutions play a pivotal role in the verification process, ensuring accurate and authentic information. Document submission initiates a verification phase to confirm the legitimacy of the documents, reducing the likelihood of fraudulent or incorrect data.

Scholarship providers access the shared system using the unique portal ID to cross-verify the information provided by the educational institutions. The aim is to ensure that students meet the eligibility criteria for the scholarships. This cross-verification process facilitates decision-making based on reliable and validated information.

The platform's key features include document verification, secure data exchange through APIs, compliance with data security regulations, and an enhanced user experience. By assigning the unique portal ID post-verification, the system ensures an accurate and secure process that minimizes potential data manipulation and fraudulent activities.

The overarching goal is to create a robust and user-centric system that ensures accuracy, credibility, and security in the verification process for out-of-state students applying for scholarships. The system lays the foundation for future enhancements, potentially incorporating AI-driven verification, further automation, and improvement in accuracy.

This Unified Verification System is designed to improve the efficacy of the scholarship eligibility verification process, ensuring equitable opportunities for students across state borders.
